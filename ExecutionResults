The following list reflects current data requests from city managers. Provide the SQL statement to satisfy each request. Test the statements and show execution results.
1.	List the following information for all crimes that have a period greater than 14 days between the date charged and the hearing date: crime ID, classification, date charged, hearing date, and number of days between the date charged and the hearing date.

SELECT crime_id, classification, date_charged, hearing_date, 
DATEDIFF(day, date_charged, hearing_date) AS before_trial
FROM crimes
WHERE hearing_date IS NOT NULL
AND DATEDIFF(day, date_charged, hearing_date) > 14;


2.	Produce a list showing each active police officer and his or her community assignment, indicated by the second letter of the precinct code. Display the community description listed in the following chart, based on the second letter of the precinct code.
Second Letter of Precinct Code	Description
A	Shady Grove
B	Center City
C	Bay Landing

SELECT CONCAT(first, ' ', last) AS name,
CASE
WHEN SUBSTRING(precinct, 2, 1) = 'A' THEN 'Shady Grove'
WHEN SUBSTRING(precinct, 2, 1) = 'B' THEN 'Center City' 
WHEN SUBSTRING(precinct, 2, 1) = 'C' THEN 'Bay Landing' 
ELSE 'No Community Assignment'
END description
FROM officers
WHERE status = 'A';



3.	Produce a list of sentencing information to include criminal ID, name (displayed in all uppercase letters), sentence ID, sentence start date, and length in months of the sentence. The number of months should be shown as a whole number. The start date should be displayed in the format “December 17, 2009.”

SELECT c.criminal_id, UPPER(CONCAT(first, ' ', last)) AS name, sentence_id, 
FORMAT(start_date, 'MMMM d, yyyy') AS start_date,
DATEDIFF(month, start_date, end_date) AS sentence_length
FROM sentences s, criminals c
WHERE s.criminal_id = c.criminal_id;


4.	A list of all amounts owed is needed. Create a list showing each criminal name, charge ID, total amount owed (fine amount plus court fee), amount paid, amount owed, and payment due date. If nothing has been paid to date, the amount paid is NULL. Include only criminals who owe some amount of money. Display the dollar amounts with a dollar sign and two decimals.

SELECT CONCAT(first, ' ',last) AS name, charge_id, 
FORMAT(fine_amount + court_fee,'C') AS total_amount_owed,
FORMAT(ISNULL(amount_paid,0),'C') AS amount_paid,
FORMAT(ISNULL(((fine_amount - court_fee) - amount_paid),0),'C')
AS amount_owed, pay_due_date
FROM crime_charges cc
JOIN crimes  c ON cc.crime_id = c.crime_id
JOIN criminals cr ON c.criminal_id = cr.criminal_id
WHERE ((cc.fine_amount + cc.court_fee) - ISNULL(cc.amount_paid,0)) > 0;

 
5.	Display the criminal name and probation start date for all criminals who have a probation period greater than two months. Also, display the date that’s two months from the beginning of the probation period, which will serve as a review date.

SELECT CONCAT(first,' ',last) AS name, start_date,
DATEADD(month, 2, start_date) AS review_date
FROM sentences s JOIN criminals c
ON s.criminal_id = c.criminal_id
WHERE type = 'P'
AND DATEDIFF(month,start_date,end_date) > 2;
